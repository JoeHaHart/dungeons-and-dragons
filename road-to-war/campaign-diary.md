# The Road To War: A Tale Of The Knights Of Hune

This is a campaign diary for a campaign started in 2017. It is set in the [Kingdom of Niven](https://github.com/JoeHaHart/dungeons-and-dragons/blob/master/world/nations/kingdom-of-niven.md).

### Prologue
Good King Aelthred, ruler of the Divine Kingdom of Niven is dead. His successor must be chosen from his surviving heirs. As is tradition in Niven an election shall be held. The rulers of each of the great provinces and houses of Niven shall travel to the Capitol to cast their votes.

### The Missing Duke
The elector for the province of Jarrhonn is Chris Hune, the young leader of the house of Hune and Duke of Jarrhonn has gone missing.

While travelling to the capitol he and his delegation had stopped at the town of Jinnhamm to rest and refuel. However he hasn’t been seen in the last week.

Worried about the oncoming election Falen, the Mayor of Tilham and advisor to Chris Hune, sent out a bounty notice offering a reward for anyone who could find and return Chris.

Our adventurers had all found this notice and arrived in Jarrhonn to gather information before setting off on their quest. While talking with the mayor the party manages to convince Falen to give them half the reward now, and the other off upon the return of Chris Hune. One of the party, the tiefling, intimidates the Mayor for more reward money.

Falen however, having pledged all his gold to the existing reward money, had only the golden chain around his neck to offer them. The party took it gladly, though they failed to realise this was the Mayoral Chain of Tilham a priceless artifact.

Ignorant of how valuable a prize they have in their possession the party marches onwards to Chris Hune’s last known location: The Market District.

### Trouble in the Market District
Arriving in the Market District the party split off; some go shopping, some investigate the missing duke. 

### The Massacre of Salgate
- Looking for Chris’s brother who is a captain in the royal army.
- Travel to the Jinnheld valley to the barracks there.
- Encounter some orcs who shouldn’t be in that area attacking a wagon train.

- They hear a whimpering coming from inside a house.
- Yargol the Half-Orc descends into the basement where the whimpering is coming from.
- He finds an orc child cowering in fear.
- It turns out the child had good reason to cower, Yargol raises his axes driven by his bloodlust of orcs and kills the child.
- The rest of the party are horrified by this needless violence.
- The only way to resolve this is an honour duel between Yargol and pretty much everyone else in the party.
- Yargol succumbs to the party and is branded by the party paladin with the mark of Bahamut.
- Walking away from the encounter the paladin does not jump on Yargol’s shoulder.
- The party finds tracks of a large host moving away from the town, they follow them.

### The General, The Succubus and the Barlgura

- They plan to confront Jeff at dinner the next day, they rally support among the men to mutiny.
- They spring the trap exposing the succubus.
- Jeff, still under her spell, attacks the party.
