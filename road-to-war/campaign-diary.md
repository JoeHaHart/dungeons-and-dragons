# The Road To War: A Tale Of The Knights Of Hune

This is a campaign diary for a campaign started in 2017. It is set in the [Kingdom of Niven](https://github.com/JoeHaHart/dungeons-and-dragons/blob/master/world/nations/kingdom-of-niven.md).

### Prologue
Good King Aelthred, ruler of the Divine Kingdom of Niven is dead. His successor must be chosen from his surviving heirs. As is tradition in Niven an election shall be held. The rulers of each of the great provinces and houses of Niven shall travel to the Capitol to cast their votes.

### The Missing Duke
The elector for the province of Jarrhonn is Chris Hune, the young leader of the house of Hune and Duke of Jarrhonn has gone missing.

While travelling to the capitol he and his delegation had stopped at the town of Jinnhamm to rest and refuel. However he hasn’t been seen in the last week.

Worried about the oncoming election Falen, the Mayor of Tilham and advisor to Chris Hune, sent out a bounty notice offering a reward for anyone who could find and return Chris.

Our adventurers had all found this notice and arrived in Jarrhonn to gather information before setting off on their quest. While talking with the mayor the party manages to convince Falen to give them half the reward now, and the other off upon the return of Chris Hune. One of the party, the tiefling, intimidates the Mayor for more reward money.

Falen however, having pledged all his gold to the existing reward money, had only the golden chain around his neck to offer them. The party took it gladly, though they failed to realise this was the Mayoral Chain of Tilham a priceless artifact.

Ignorant of how valuable a prize they have in their possession the party marches onwards to Chris Hune’s last known location: The Market District.

### Trouble in the Market District
Arriving in the Market District the party split off; some go shopping, some investigate the missing duke.

- He finds an orc child cowering in fear.
- It turns out the child had good reason to cower, Yargol raises his axes driven by his bloodlust of orcs and kills the child.
- The rest of the party are horrified by this needless violence.
- The only way to resolve this is an honour duel between Yargol and pretty much everyone else in the party.
- Yargol succumbs to the party and is branded by the party paladin with the mark of Bahamut.
- Walking away from the encounter the paladin does not jump on Yargol’s shoulder.
- The party finds tracks of a large host moving away from the town, they follow them.

### The General, The Succubus and the Barlgura

- They spring the trap exposing the succubus.
- Jeff, still under her spell, attacks the party.

### The First Moot
Our heroes were able to meet and judge the candidates for the Kingdom. The final elector arrives and it is Kennethor, Duke of Kilhonn.

They meet the mad old ruler Amerhonn, who whispers to a possessed ring thinking the voice of his dead wife. The dead wife ring supports Theresa for the throne. After communing with their old friend Baphomet who they released from The Abyss previously, they find out the ring is actually being possessed by the forces of Cam'eh'run.

The party goes after Arthur Wobblesnoot, Duke of Pyhonn. Inadvertently end up making him fall in love with Karen. They end up getting married, then setting up a duel between Amros Endhon and Wobblesnoot. In the ensuing duel Arthur is killed. With no children, his title goes to his wife Karen.

### Who keeps trying to kill us
While all this going on an assassin attempts to take out some members of the party, since they seem to be support Osbourne for the throne. The assassin was oddly part orc, part elf. The party made quick work of them.

### Some stuff happens.
### Vardri High Priest
Through the election process the party meet Vardri the High Priest who is running the election and seems to favour Theresa, the youngest and least experienced of the candidates. The eventually go to confront him at the central Tower To The Divine in the heart of the city.

There it is revealed that Vardri is in league with Kennethor. Kennethor was in a secret relationship with Theresa. The plan was to get her elected and Kennethor could become king.
Though now it is revealed that forces darkness conspire to have Theresa on the throne, Vardri is having second thoughts.
There is a great fight between Kennethor and the party. The party triumphs and Osbourne is pronounced King.
### Long Live The King
King Osbourne I takes the crown, now aware that the ancient protections his father put in place across the kingdom are waning. The barriers between worlds are opening. He must protect his kingdom and his people.

## The Oncoming Storm

### Preparing for the Storm
Osbourne summons all of his dukes to his new throne room to tell them of Kennthor’s betrayal and death. He also announces that ancient protections maintained by his father are now waning. To prepare for the incoming waves of demons and fiends he commands his vassals to return to their cities. To fortify them and to take in any refugees from surrounding villages who need shelter.

Vardri the High Priest protests, wishing to find a magical solution to the problem. Osbourne cuts him off. Vardri asks our heroes to follow him to the central tower to talk through his plan.

### The Quest For The First Temple
Vardri asks our heroes to ego to where the ruins of the first temple are in an attempt to find anything that could help with rebuilding the inter-planar defences.

Our heroes protest this, saying they will not go on this quest without try backing from Vardri or some reward. Vardri has no reward to give. However, as in ancient times, he shall form The Inquisition. A free wing of the church that can act reactively in times of great need.

He writes a document saying that Jiida is now the High Inquisitor of the realm, but forgets to sign it.

Also the party asks for help to go with them to identify anything they need. Vardri suggests Hammond, brother of King Osbourne, who has been buried in books since his electoral defeat.

### Having fun isn’t hard if you have a library card.
While searching for Hammond our heroes get library cards, lifetime for Yargol and Jiida, 1 year for Shnook. They find Hammond in the agriculture section and get him to come with them to the first temple.

They get out some books. Shnook gets A History of Obscure Wards and Spells , learning how to ward buildings from abyssal forces. Yargol gets a history of King Aelthread IV the Bloody, a short history of the mad rulers 3 year reign of terror. Heli looks up an ancient Druid stone tablet about pathways between realms.

### Preparing for the road ahead
With Hammond in tow the heroes return to their Duchal villa in the royal district. There they bump into Geoff Hune, who is packing up for his way back to Tilham and his duchy. He wishes them a fond farewell and blesses them to keep their title as the Knights Of Hune.

The summon servants in the Villa of Wobblesnoot to make ready a wagon and supply’s. Jiida summons his celestial Mastiff mount.

### The Uneventful Road
On the road to the first temple they see refugees heading to the city. Jiida flashes these passers by his Library Card mistakenly instead of his High Inquisitor certificate.

Eventually they come acrosss a wealthy market town a days ride from the capital. The find and inn nearby. The Black Rose, Shnook attempts to get a room for free with a song but the
